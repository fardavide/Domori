This file contains main instructions to run at every prompt. The agent should update this file with relevant information, or refence relevant files to consult, like readme other. THe agent can udpate this file autonomously

## Generic
- On a change:
    - First write tests: unit test and, if necessary, UI tests. Using swift-testing when possible
    - Then make sure readme is updated
- When running Swift app (or tests), check if a simulator is already running; if more than one, or none, prefer iPhone 16 pro as target
- When commit, use an emoji at the start to identify its type
- Ensure to maintain a nice documentstion of decisions that worked and ones that failed
- Never commit temporary files. If you need some documentation, make sure it's well organized and indexed in a way you can reach it from a future prompt; perhaps we should add some indices into this file?

## CodeStyle
- When parameters are on multiple line, ensure a good wrapping like `func name(\npar1,\npar2\n)`
